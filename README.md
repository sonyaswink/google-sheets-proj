## QUESTION/HEDE: The US Population is Aging into Dementia, and Will The Sandwich Generation Be Hurt by it

### HYPOTHESIS: The Sandwich Generation, people caring for a young child and an aging parent, is being covered more and more in the news. This is twelve percent of Americans in the U.S. https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/11/parenting/sandwich-generation-costs.html

### Now, as dementia and Alzheimer's are being reported as a growing trend, along with the population living longer, will those people caring for children have to care for a parent with mental diseases? Or is the data just showing diagnoses and a leveling-off?

#### Many Americans aren't worried at all about their aging parents being an issue. https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2014/01/30/attitudes-about-aging-a-global-perspective/

##### However, When aging adults need assistance handling their affairs or caring for themselves, family members often help out. Among those with a parent age 65 or older who needs this type of assistance, 31% say they provide most of this help, and an additional 48% say they provide at least some of the help https://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2013/01/30/the-sandwich-generation/

###### State-by-state in the US, more people are aging into Alzheimers diagnoses. Some 11 percent of men 20 percent of women are susceptible at age 45 for developing dementia. https://www.alz.org/media/Documents/alzheimers-facts-and-figures-2019-r.pdf

###### My story will explore data from the CDC, Alzheimer's organizations and more to determine if the prevalence of growing incidence of the disease is correllated with greater reporting versus previous populations, or if it is the result of a longer-living population, and how that will affect the financial, physical and emotonal health of their grown adult children, many of whom had children themselves at a later age and are facing those obligations of raising young ones.

##### Also exploring data on whether medications are linked to causing Alzheimers. This is new research. https://abc3340.com/news/abc-3340-news-iteam/potential-link-between-popular-medications-and-dementia
